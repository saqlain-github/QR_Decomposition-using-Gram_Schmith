QR Factorization 

If A is an m x n matrix with linearly independent columns, 
then A can be factored as A = QR where Q is an m x n 
matrix whose columns form an orthonormal basis for Col A  
and R is an n x n upper triangular invertible matrix with 
positive entries on its diagonal

To find R, observe that QTQ = I because columns of Q are orthonormal
